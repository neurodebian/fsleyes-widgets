.. sidebar:: I can't navigate with the keyboard!

             Under OSX, you may need to enable *Full keyboard access* for the
             melodic classification panel to work with keyboard
             navigation/focus.  This setting can be changed through *System
             Preferences* |right_arrow| *Keyboard* |right_arrow| *Shortcuts*,
             and changing *Full Keyboard Access* to *All controls*.
