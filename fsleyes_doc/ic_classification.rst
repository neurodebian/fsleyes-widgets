IC classification
=================



.. sidebar:: I can't navigate with the keyboard!

             Under OSX, you may have focus-related issues while navigating
             around the IC classification panel with the keyboard. 

             If this is happening to you, you may need to enable *Full
             keyboard access* for the melodic classification panel to work
             with keyboard navigation/focus.  This setting can be changed
             through *System Preferences* |right_arrow| *Keyboard*
             |right_arrow| *Shortcuts*, and changing *Full Keyboard Access* to
             *All controls*.
