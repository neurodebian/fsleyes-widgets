TODO LIST -*- mode: org; -*-

A mixture of things to do, and things which might be nice to do.  Order is
arbitrary. Check https://internal.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/i-wiki/Analysis/Todos/FSLView
regularly, too.


* Bugs to fix
** Exceptions thrown on empty image name
** Slice changes on ludo's bad image, when using pixdim transformation.
** Cursor location moving along other dimensions on X canvas mouse movement in Ludo's bad image.
** No worky in VNC session.
** Make range widget limit buttons expand properly. Ugh. Works fine under linux. This looks like an OSX Mavericks bug.
** Wild cards in image file load (WX/OSX issue)
** DONE is av.nii.gz being displayed properly? Yep, it's interpolation causing a bit of weirdness, but it is being displayed correctly.
** DONE Lightbox is a bit temperemental at the moment.
** DONE KeyError in fslviewframe when control panels are removed
** DONE elistbox labels not shown?
** DONE elistbox throwing errors randomly.
** DONE gl21 - Voxel opacity when sampling rate > 1 is not correct.
** DONE Image not updating/redrawing properly on transform matrix change
** DONE Control panels no longer persistent across restarts?
** DONE JALAPENO - Image List background colour no worky
** DONE JALAPENO - LightBoxCanvas mouse scroll no worky
** DONE gl14 - Transparent voxels are green ?!?
** DONE Non-FSLView tools are broken due to fsl.py Panel->Frame changes
** DONE LocationPanel volume bounds.
** DONE Fix cursors - they go off the canvas in some cases
** DONE LightBoxCanvas bounding box calculation is broken again.
** DONE SliceCanvas bounding box calculation is also broken again.
** DONE Fix mouse tracking (voxel changes)
** DONE Transformation matrix recursion is happening again, for Ludo's file with the bad affine.
** DONE Selected image sync between all the control panels is a bit iffy
** DONE Cursor location on lightboxcanvas, when Z is not the depth axis
** DONE Voxel location widgets not updating properly when image is changed
** DONE Min z distance on lightboxcanvas not working?
** DONE OSX SegFault when all view tabs removed??
** DONE Graceful handling of bad input filenames
** DONE Aspect ratio on slicecanvas zoom, and panning is broken.
* Little things
** Make ColourBarPanel generic.
** Optimisations - tune image._transform, and glimage.genVertexData functions. Go back to using triangle strips?
** Get rid of imagefile module, put functionality in image module.
** View/view config panels persist across shutdown/restart
This is tough, because the old agw.AUINotebook implementation does not have
any ability to query layout.
** Ability to edit image affine transformation.
** Orientation labels on slice canvas.
** 'Create mask image' option
** DONE Colour bar showing image value range
** DONE Make image list navigator widget listen to image name changes.
** DONE Spline interpolation
** DONE Ability to change selected image in image display and cursor location panels.
** DONE Disable/enable next/prev buttons on elistbox and imageselect panel as necessary.
** WONTFIX Cursor location preservation when transformation option is changed. The world location is preserved.
** DONE Set cursor location via command line option.
** DONE Cursor bound restriction on ortho panel.
** DONE Refactor/merge GL14<->Gl21 image data code, as there is a lot of shared functionality.
** DONE Rethink 4D handling - image.display.volume or imageList.volume?
** DONE Clip Low/Clip High display options
** DONE Clear image names on location panel and image display panel when image list is empty.
** DONE Interpolation option when displaying in real world space
** DONE Use GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT to avoid the need to pad texture images.
** DONE Superclasses for view/control panels.
** DONE Separate display properties from fsl.data.fslimage classes? A separate fsl.fslview.displaycontext module?
** DONE Named view panels
** DONE View config panels should be dockable.
** DONE Focus/display newly opened view tabs
** DONE Display current location on new lightboxcanvas, and when light box props change
** DONE Truncate long filenames in image list panel.
** DONE Labels for individual bound/point widget sliders.
** DONE Vertically center widget property labels.
** DONE Fix image bounds calculation (for images with dodgy affines)
** DONE Constraint listener on Lists which is notified of changes to constraints on any of the items in the list
** DONE 'Add standard'/'Add Atlas' menu options.
** DONE Update LightBoxCanvas properties - check out funny behaviour in ncols.
** DONE Pan in LightBoxCanvas, so currently selected location is always on screen.
** DONE Min distance for LightBoxCanvas.zrange.
** DONE If image files were specified on the command line, make sure the open file dialog defaults to one of their paths.
** DONE Float formatting on range slider buttons
** DONE Enable/disable ImageList<->Canvas position sync - 'link' property on slice canvas/orthopanel, or something.
** DONE SliceCanvas initial location set from image list
* Medium things
** Profiles (e.g. 'view', 'edit', 'analyse?', etc etc). 
This will probably dictate how you go about implementing keyboard/mouse control
** Keyboard/mouse control
*** Arrow keys to move cursor location - how to select which x/y axes are controlled?
*** Mouse/keyboard controls for panning/zooming
** Image export/offscreen rendering.
** DONE Image List functionality
*** DONE double click to show/hide
*** DONE Edit image name
*** DONE Highlight enabled/disabled images
** DONE Custom colour maps from original FSLView
** DONE Command line interface - build into props package?
** DONE Remove voxel<->world orthogonality requirement
** DONE Make slice canvas bounding box calculation more intelligent when zoom > 1.
** DONE separate out props and gui packages - they should really be separate projects
** DONE location panel (information about currently selected location) - add a 'location' property to the imagelist so we can link across different views.
** DONE Location selection on LightBoxCanvas.
* Big/ambiguous things
** Test suite for props package
** Code audit - enforce consistent standards for public/private class members
** image editing (e.g. selecting, erasing, filling, mask creation)
** Surface display. Who does surface stuff?
** Other data - Diffusion. Talk to Saad and Manu.
** IN PROGRESS time series plotting option
** IN PROGRESS Standard for code documentation - Sphinx.
** DONE OpenGL 1.4 implementation - required for running over SSH/VNC.
** DONE have multiple views open - look at wxAUI.
* Other ideas
** (Saad). Select regions by colour, for editing purposes
** (Eugene). Perhaps some useful viewing functionality would be a helper viewer to explore high-level (gfeat) analyses directories - simple browsing tools for quickly loading and unloading stats files, contrasts etc.  Then it might move to be able to link to lower level dirs.  Pretty much like a viewer version of the webpage reports.
** (Mark). That colourmaps for label images (e.g. HarvardOxford subcortical) uses the display range info rather than totally ignores it.  I'd like to be able to threshold away some structures using the display range, but at the moment that cannot be done.
** (Mark). The ability to have separate display ranges for different volumes in one 4D image (maybe only when automatically calculated?) which would be especially useful for diffusion series where the b=0 images are way brighter than the others when using the same display range.
** (Ludo). Automatic cluster size thresholding (e.g. Z threshold/cluster size)
** (Paul). Slice-wise (instead of image-wise) glimagedata implementation for very large images.
