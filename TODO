TODO LIST -*- mode: org; -*-

A mixture of things to do, and things which might be nice to do.  Order is
arbitrary.

* Bugs to fix
** Fix cursors - they go off the canvas in some cases
** LightBoxCanvas bounding box calculation is broken again.
** SliceCanvas bounding box calculation is also broken again.
** Trnasformation matrix recursion is happening again, for Ludo's file with the bad affine.

* Little things
** Wild cards in image file load (controlled by fslview.ImageListPanel)
** Truncate long filenames in image list panel.
** Make range widget limit buttons expand properly. Ugh. Works fine under linux. This looks like an OSX Mavericks bug.
** DONE Labels for individual bound/point widget sliders.
** Vertically center widget property labels.
** DONE Fix image bounds calculation (for images with dodgy affines)
** DONE Constraint listener on Lists which is notified of changes to constraints on any of the items in the list
** Ability to edit image affine transformation.
** Fix mouse tracking (voxel changes)
** Orientation labels on slice canvas.
** 'Add standard'/'Add Atlas' menu options.

* Medium things
** more features on image list panel - e.g. double click to show/hide, 'link' checkbox, 'lock' checkbox, edit image name..
** location panel (information about currently selected location) - add a 'location' property to the imagelist so we can link across different views.
** Location selection on LightBoxCanvas.
** change image dimension ordering
** link display properties across images
** separate out props and gui packages - they should really be separate projects
** mouse-based zooming in ortho panel
** Make slice canvas bounding box calculation more intelligent when zoom > 1.
** Image export/offscreen rendering.
** IN PROGRESS Command line interface - build into props package?
** UI design
** Rewrite GL storage/rendering
 - Do away with your fancy x-coordinate tiling, and just store coordinates for every voxel.
 - Calculate the proper coordinates of a real-world Z slice through the image. 
** Custon colour maps from original FSLView

* Big things
** Test suite for props package
** slice-wise (instead of image-wise) glimagedata implementation for very large images.
** Code audit - enforce conistent standards for public/private class members
** Standard for code documentation - Sphinx?
** OpenGL 1.4 implementation
** time series plotting option
** have multiple views open - look at wxAUI.
** image editing (e.g. selecting, erasing, filling, mask creation)
** Surface display


* Other ideas
** (Saad). Select regions by colour, for editing purposes
** (Eugene). Perhaps some useful viewing functionality would be a helper viewer to explore high-level (gfeat) analyses directories - simple browsing tools for quickly loading and unloading stats files, contrasts etc.  Then it might move to be able to link to lower level dirs.  Pretty much like a viewer version of the webpage reports.
