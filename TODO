TODO LIST -*- mode: org; -*-

A mixture of things to do, and things which might be nice to do.  Order is
arbitrary.

* Little things
** Truncate long filenames in image list panel.
** Make range widget limit buttons expand properly. Ugh. Works fine under linux. This looks like an OSX Mavericks bug.
** DONE Labels for individual bound/point widget sliders.
** Vertically center widget property labels.
** Fix image bounds calculation (for images with dodgy affines)
** Constraint listener on Lists which is notified of changes to constraints on any of the items in the list.

* Medium things
** more features on image list panel - e.g. double click to show/hide, 'link' checkbox, 'lock' checkbox
** location panel (information about currently selected location) - add a 'location' property to the imagelist so we can link across different views.
** Selection on LightBoxCanvas.
** change image dimension ordering
** ability to edit affine transformation
** link display properties across images
** separate out props and gui packages - they should really be separate projects
** mouse-based zooming in ortho panel
** Make slice canvas bounding box calculation more intelligent when zoom > 1.

* Big things
** slice-wise (instead of image-wise) glimagedata implementation for very large images.
** Code audit - enforce conistent standards for public/private class members
** Standard for code documentation - Sphinx?
** opengl 1.4 implementation
** time series plotting option
** have multiple views open
** image editing (e.g. selecting, erasing, filling, mask creation)
