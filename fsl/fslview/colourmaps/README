FSLView Colour maps
-------------------

All files in this directory ending with '.cmap' will be loaded by FSLView,
interpreted as a list of RGB colours, and added as a colour map option for
rendering images.

Each .cmap file is assumed to contain a list of RGB colours, one per line,
with each colour specified by three space-separated floating point values in
the range 0.0 - 1.0.

Feel free to add your own .cmap files, and put them in this directory. When
FSLView is restarted, they will be made available under the colour map
setting in image display options. 

You may also add any colour maps which are built into Matplotlib - see the
fsl.fslview.colourmaps module for more details.
