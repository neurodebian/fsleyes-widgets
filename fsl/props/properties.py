# properties.py - Python descriptors of various types.
#
# This module should not be imported directly - import the fsl.props
# package instead. Property type definitions are in properties_types.py.
#
# Usage:
#
#     >>> import fsl.props as props
#
#     >>> class PropObj(props.HasProperties):
#     >>>     myProperty = props.Boolean()
#
#     >>> myPropObj = PropObj()
#
#
#     # Access the property value as a normal attribute:
#     >>> myPropObj.myProperty = True
#     >>> myPropObj.myProperty
#     >>> True
#
#
#     # access the props.Boolean instance:
#     >>> myPropObj.getProp('myProperty')
#     >>> <props.prop.Boolean at 0x1045e2710>
#
#
#     # access the underlying props.PropertyValue object
#     # (there are caveats for List properties):
#     >>> myPropObj.getPropVal('myProperty')
#     >>> <props.prop.PropertyValue instance at 0x1047ef518>
#
#
#     # Receive notification of property value changes
#     >>> def myPropertyChanged(value, *args):
#     >>>     print('New property value: {}'.format(value))
#
#     >>> myPropObj.addListener(
#     >>>    'myProperty', 'myListener', myPropertyChanged)
# 
#     >>> myPropObj.myProperty = False
#     >>> New property value: False
#
#
#     # Remove a previously added listener
#     >>> myPropObj.removeListener('myListener')

# Lots of the code in this file is probably very confusing. First of
# all, you will need to understand python descriptors.  Descriptors are
# a way of adding properties to python objects, and allowing them to be
# accessed as if they were just simple attributes of the object, but
# controlling the way that the attributes are accessed and assigned.
#
# The following link provides a good overview, and contains the ideas
# which form the basis for the implementation in this module:
#
#  -  http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/\
#     ChrisBeaumont/5758381/raw/descriptor_writeup.ipynb
#
# And if you've got 30 minutes, this video gives a very good
# introduction to descriptors:

#
#
# A HasProperties (sub)class contains a collection of PropertyBase instances
# as class attributes. When an instance of the HasProperties class is created,
# one or more PropertyValue objects are created for each of the PropertyBase
# instances. For most properties, there is a one-to-one mapping between
# PropertyValue instances and PropertyBase instances (per HasProperties
# instance), however this is not mandatory.  For example, the List property
# manages multiple PropertyValue objects for each HasProperties instance.
#
#
# Each of these PropertyValue instances encapsulates a single value, of any
# type.  Whenever a variable value changes, the PropertyValue instance passes
# the new value to the validate method of its parent PropertyBase instance to
# determine whether the new value is valid, and notifies any registered
# listeners of the change. The PropertyValue object will allow its underlying
# value to be set to something invalid, but it will tell registered listeners
# whether the new value is valid or invalid (PropertyValue objects  can
# alternately be configured to raise a ValueError on an attempt to set them
# to an invalid value, but this has some caveats - see the
# PropertyValue.__init__ docstring).
#
#
# The default validation logic of most PropertyBase objects can be configured
# via 'constraints'. For example, the Number property  allows 'minval' and
# 'maxval' constraints to be set.  These may be set via PropertyBase
# constructors, (i.e. when it is defined as a class attribute of a
# HasProperties definition), and may be queried and changed on individual
# HasProperties instances via the getConstraint/setConstraint methods,
# which are available on both PropertyBase and HasProperties objects.
#
#
# Application code may be notified of property changes in two ways.  First, a
# listener may be registered with a PropertyBase object, either via the
# HasProperties.addListener instance method, or the PropertyBase.addListener
# class method (these are equivalent).  Such a listener will be notified of
# changes to any of the PropertyValue objects managed by the PropertyBase
# object, and associated with the HasProperties instance. This is important
# for List properties, as it means that a change to a single PropertyValue
# object in a list will result in notification of all registered listeners.
#
#
# If one is interested in changes to a single PropertyValue object (e.g. one
# element of a List property), then a listener may be registered directly with
# the PropertyValue object, via the PropertyValue.addListener instance
# method. This listener will then only be notified of changes to that
# PropertyValue object.
