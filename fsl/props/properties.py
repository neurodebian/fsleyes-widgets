# properties.py - Python descriptors of various types.
#
# This module should not be imported directly - import the fsl.props
# package instead. Property type definitions are in properties_types.py.
#
# Usage:
#
#     import Tkinter as tk
#     import tkprops as tkp
#
#
#     class PropObj(tkp.HasProperties):
#         myProperty = tkp.Boolean()
#
#
#     # The Tk root object must be created
#     # before any HasProperties objects.
#     app       = tk.Tk()
#     myPropObj = PropObj()
#
#
#     # Access the property value as a normal attribute:
#     myPropObj.myProperty = True
#     myPropObj.myProperty
#
#     # >>> True
#
#
#     # access the tkp.Boolean instance:
#     myPropObj.getTkProp('myProperty')
#
#     # >>> <tkprops.tkprop.Boolean at 0x1045e2710>
#
#
#     # access the underlying Tkinter control variable
#     # (there are caveats for List properties):
#     myPropObj.getTkVar('myProperty').tkVar
#
#     # >>> <tkinter.BooleanVar instance at 0x1047ef518>
#
#
#     # Receive notification of property value changes
#     def myPropertyChanged(instance, name, value):
#         print('New value for {}: {}'.format(name, value))
#
#     PropObj.myProperty.addListener(
#         myPropObj, 'myListener', myPropertyChanged)
# 
#     myPropObj.myProperty = False
#
#     # >>> New value for myProperty: False
#
#
#     # Remove a previously added listener
#     PropObj.myProperty.removeListener(myPropObj, 'myListener')
#
# 
# Lots of the code in this file is probably very confusing. First of
# all, you will need to understand python descriptors.  Descriptors are
# a way of adding properties to python objects, and allowing them to be
# accessed as if they were just simple attributes of the object, but
# controlling the way that the attributes are accessed and assigned.
#
# The following link provides a good overview, and contains the ideas
# which form the basis for the implementation in this module:
#
#  -  http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/\
#     ChrisBeaumont/5758381/raw/descriptor_writeup.ipynb
#
# And if you've got 30 minutes, this video gives a very good
# introduction to descriptors:
#
#  - http://pyvideo.org/video/1760/encapsulation-with-descriptors
#
# Once you know how Python descriptors work, you then need to know how
# Tk control variables work. These are simple objects which may be
# passed to a Tkinter widget object when it is created. When a user
# modifies the widget value, the Tk control variable is
# modified. Conversely, if the value of a Tk control variable object is
# modified, any widgets which are bound to the variable are updated to
# reflect the new value.
#
# This module, and the associated tkpropwidget module, uses magic to
# encapsulate Tkinter control variables within python descriptors, thus
# allowing custom validation rules to be enforced on such control
# variables.
#
# The runtime structure of Tk properties is organised as follows:
#
# A HasProperties (sub)class contains a collection of PropertyBase
# instances. When an instance of the HasProperties class is created, one
# or more TkVarProxy objects are created for each of the PropertyBase
# instances. For most properties, there is a one-to-one mapping between
# TkVarProxy instances and PropertyBase instances (for each
# HasProperties instance), however this is not mandatory.  For example,
# the List property manages multiple TkVarProxy objects for each
# HasProperties instance.

# Each of these TkVarProxy instances encapsulates a single Tkinter
# control variable.  Whenever a variable value changes, the TkVarProxy
# instance passes the new value to the validate method of its parent
# PropertyBase instance to determine whether the new value is valid, and
# notifies any registered listeners of the change. The TkVarProxy object
# will allow its underlying Tkinter variable to be given invalid values,
# but it will tell registered listeners whether the new value is valid
# or invalid.
#
# Application code may be notified of property changes in two ways.
# First, a listener may be registered with a PropertyBase object, by
# passing a reference to the HasProperties instance, a name, and a
# callback function to the PropertyBase.addListener method.  Such a
# listener will be notified of changes to any of the TkVarProxy objects
# managed by the PropertyBase object, and associated with the
# HasProperties instance. This is important for List properties, as it
# means that a change to a single TkVarProxy object in a list will
# result in notification of all registered listeners.
#
# If one is interested in changes to a single TkVarProxy object
# (e.g. one element of a List property), then a listener may be
# registered directly with the TkVarProxy object. This listener will
# then only be notified of changes to that TkVarProxy object.
